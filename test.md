Great idea. Here’s an **add-on section** you can paste into your existing `README.md` to enable local testing with the ADK web playground. It’s written to fit your current README’s tone and structure.

## Local Web Testing with ADK (`adk web`)

The quickest way to try the agent end-to-end is with the ADK web playground.

### 1) Install the CLI

```bash
# Prefer pipx (isolated)
pipx install adk

# or with pip (inside your virtualenv)
pip install adk
```

> Check it’s installed:

```bash
adk --version
```

### 2) Environment & auth (local)

Create/populate `.env` as usual (see Setup). For **local** testing, you typically don’t need Vertex; if you do, keep the same Google auth steps from the deployment section.

* Local only (no Vertex): set `GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=false` (or leave unset).
* If using Vertex-backed tools locally, make sure you’ve run:

  ```bash
  gcloud auth application-default login
  gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project $GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
  ```

### 3) Start the playground

From the project root:

```bash
# If your project has an ADK manifest (e.g., adk.yaml) in the root:
adk web

# If your manifest or entry is elsewhere, point to it explicitly, for example:
adk web --entry deployment/adk_app.py

# Optional flags
adk web --port 5173              # default is usually fine
adk web --host 0.0.0.0           # bind for LAN access
adk web --log-level INFO         # DEBUG for deeper troubleshooting
```

This will launch a local UI at something like:

```
http://localhost:5173
```

Use the UI to:

* Provide a PDF/DOI/URL of a seminal paper,
* Ask the agent to summarize, find recent citing works, and propose research directions.

### 4) Troubleshooting

* **“No manifest/entry found”**: pass `--entry` to the agent’s Python entry (e.g., an `app.py` that builds/starts the agent) or place an `adk.yaml` in the repo root.
* **Import errors**: ensure the virtualenv is active and the package is installed in editable mode:

  ```bash
  source .venv/bin/activate
  uv pip install -e .
  ```
* **Credential/permission errors (Vertex)**: verify `GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT`, `GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION`, and that `gcloud auth application-default login` succeeded.
* **Port in use**: pick another port, e.g., `adk web --port 5174`.

If you’d like, I can merge this into your current `README.md` for you and (optionally) add a tiny `adk.yaml`/`adk_app.py` scaffold if you don’t have one yet.
